## 2. What Changed

Range reviewed: `b152f023..94053622`

- 3 commits total in range.
- 1 merged PR:
  - `#3345` Review #56 artifact publication + milestone/index closeout sync for `M271`.
- Diff summary: 5 files changed, 190 insertions(+).

Net: this cycle is documentation/spec closure only, with no runtime or feature-surface expansion.

## 3. Quality Posture

Current hygiene markers remain stable:

- `unsafe {}`: 3
- non-test `.unwrap()`: 2
- `panic!`: 122
- `todo!()` / `unimplemented!()`: 0
- `#[allow(...)]`: 1

Top crates by Rust LOC (tracked source on `origin/master`):

| Lines | Crate |
|---:|---|
| 48,417 | tau-coding-agent |
| 29,980 | tau-gateway |
| 18,474 | tau-multi-channel |
| 16,429 | tau-tools |
| 15,842 | tau-onboarding |

## 4. Self-Improvement Status

Self-improvement loop status is unchanged from Review #56 and remains closed/completed:

- Phase 1: intrinsic rewards - done
- Phase 2: cross-session synthesis - done
- Phase 3: prompt self-optimization (APO live integration) - done
- Phase 4: curriculum + meta-cognition depth - done
- Phase 5: OpenTelemetry export paths - done

Operational consistency remains aligned:

- Milestone `M271` is closed and milestone index is marked completed.
- Related issue `#3344` is closed with `status:done`.

## 5. Risks / Gaps

No new critical engineering gaps were introduced in this cycle.

Residual risk remains low and process-oriented (metric-method drift across reviews), not runtime-behavior risk.

---

## 6. Verdict

Review #57 is a post-merge stabilization snapshot with no new runtime debt and consistent tracker/spec alignment.

**Overall: A+ (stable).**
