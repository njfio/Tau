# Issue 1690 Tasks

Status: Implemented

## Ordered Tasks

T1 (tests-first): capture module-header coverage gap for selected files.

T2: add `//!` boundary docs across selected `tau-tools`/`tau-runtime` modules.

T3: add targeted policy/safety and reason-code/error contract notes.

T4: run docs/contract regression checks and finalize evidence.

## Tier Mapping

- Functional: module headers added and readable
- Conformance: policy/safety/error contract notes present
- Regression: docs link and quality-remediation contract tests remain green
