# Tasks: Issue #3296 - wire APO scheduler and guarded prompt adoption into live RL runtime

- [x] T1 (RED): add failing conformance/regression tests for APO execution, non-significant skip, and significant adoption persistence.
- [x] T2 (GREEN): extend runtime config/startup wiring for APO dependencies and controls.
- [x] T3 (GREEN): implement span-to-APO dataset assembly, APO execution, and significance-gated adoption flow.
- [x] T4 (GREEN): persist APO diagnostics in optimizer report and adopted prompt resources metadata.
- [x] T5 (VERIFY): run targeted tau-coding-agent tests for C-01/C-02/C-03 plus existing optimizer regression.
- [x] T6 (VERIFY): run fmt + clippy (`tau-coding-agent`, `-D warnings`).
