# M51 — Gap Revalidation Wave 2 (Functional/Distribution/Ops)

Milestone: [GitHub milestone #51](https://github.com/njfio/Tau/milestone/51)

## Objective

Revalidate functional, distribution, and ops gap claims (items 5-15) with executable evidence, and synchronize roadmap status with what the code and tests currently prove.

## Scope

- Add a repeatable verification runner for claims 5-15.
- Execute mapped commands and ensure fail-closed behavior.
- Update roadmap documentation with dated claim status and evidence.

## Out of Scope

- Building net-new platform capabilities outside the validated claim set.
- Full architecture migrations (for example WASI preview migration) in this wave.
