# M252 - Review #37 / M251 closeout consistency

Status: In Progress

## Context
Milestone `M251` was closed after completing APO live runtime integration and Review #37 Phase-4 follow-up work, but repository milestone-index status remained stale.

## Scope
- Align `specs/milestones/m251/index.md` status with closed milestone state.
- Add concise closeout note referencing merged completion work.
- Keep issue/milestone linkage and lifecycle artifacts consistent.

## Linked Issues
- Task: #3304

## Success Signals
- `specs/milestones/m251/index.md` reports completed status and closeout note.
- `specs/3304/spec.md`, `specs/3304/plan.md`, and `specs/3304/tasks.md` are present and implemented.
