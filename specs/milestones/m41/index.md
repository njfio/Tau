# Milestone M41: README Accuracy Refresh

Status: Draft

## Objective

Align top-level `README.md` statements with current repository behavior,
capability boundaries, and tracker status.

## Scope

In scope:

- README wording corrections where claims drifted from current delivered state
- training boundary/status language alignment (prompt optimization vs true-RL artifacts)
- link/path/command existence verification for touched README references

Out of scope:

- broad documentation rewrite across the docs tree
- runtime behavior changes

## Success Signals

- M41 hierarchy exists with epic/story/task/subtask linkage.
- README statements in touched sections are factual and verifiable against repo state.
- Docs quality checks for the README update pass.
