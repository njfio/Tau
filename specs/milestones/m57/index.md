# M57 — README Accuracy and Capability Alignment

Milestone: [GitHub milestone #57](https://github.com/njfio/Tau/milestone/57)

## Objective

Align `README.md` with current merged repository behavior so top-level capability
claims are accurate and directly traceable to present runtime/provider support.

## Scope

- Audit README statements against current code for provider coverage and runtime
  capability wording.
- Patch stale statements without broad editorial rewrite.
- Validate local link/path references remain correct.

## Out of Scope

- Architecture changes.
- Large docs reorganization outside `README.md`.

## Linked Hierarchy

- Epic: #2349
- Story: #2350
- Task: #2351
- Subtask: #2352
