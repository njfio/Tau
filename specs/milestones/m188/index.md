# M188 - Training Proxy Coverage Hardening

## Context
`tau-training-proxy` has foundational tests but limited coverage for upstream error metadata and response header behavior. This milestone expands conformance/regression depth for proxy reliability.

## Scope
- Extend `tau-training-proxy` tests for health/failure/metadata paths.
- Add minimal runtime behavior needed by new conformance tests.
- Keep changes scoped to the proxy crate and issue-linked specs.

## Linked Issues
- Epic: #3038
- Story: #3039
- Task: #3040
