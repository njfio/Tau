# M199 - Tau Ops Dashboard PRD Phase 3L (Memory Graph Node Detail Contracts)

## Context
Implements Tau Ops Dashboard PRD memory-graph checklist contract:
- `2091` "Click node shows detail panel"

for `/ops/memory-graph`.

## Linked Issues
- Epic: #3084
- Story: #3085
- Task: #3086

## Scope
- Deterministic node-selection markers for memory graph rows.
- Deterministic node detail href contracts for graph-route selection.
- Graph-route detail panel markers bound to selected memory entry.
- Regression safety for existing memory-graph and memory-explorer contracts.

## Out of Scope
- Hover highlight behavior (`2092`).
- Zoom/pan/filter interactions (`2093`-`2095`).
- New dependencies or protocol changes.
