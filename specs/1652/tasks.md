# Issue 1652 Tasks

Status: Implemented

## Ordered Tasks

T1 (tests-first): add allocation contract test skeleton for quota math and docs
references.

T2: author machine-readable allocation artifact with crate quotas and
checkpoint totals.

T3: publish human-readable allocation summary/guide.

T4: run contract + docs checks and finalize issue evidence.

## Tier Mapping

- Functional: quota table fields and docs summary presence
- Conformance: `target >= 3000` and sum-of-deltas math invariant
- Integration: docs index and scorecard references to allocation guide
- Regression: contract test enforces schema/cadence/checkpoint invariants
