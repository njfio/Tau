# Plan #2458

## Approach

1. Create accepted specs/plans/tasks for epic/story/task/subtask under M78.
2. Implement task #2460 with test-first flow through #2461.
3. Verify scoped gates and update issue/process logs.

## Risks

- Over-pruning through duplicate handling if canonical selection is unstable.
- Heartbeat integration errors could spam diagnostics.
