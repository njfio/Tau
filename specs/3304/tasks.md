# Tasks: Issue #3304 - M251 closeout consistency

- [x] T1 (RED): verify current drift (`specs/milestones/m251/index.md` still reports in-progress while milestone is closed).
- [x] T2 (GREEN): update `specs/milestones/m251/index.md` to completed status and add closeout note.
- [x] T3 (VERIFY): run deterministic conformance checks for status and closeout references.
