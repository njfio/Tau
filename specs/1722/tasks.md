# Issue 1722 Tasks

Status: Implemented

## Ordered Tasks

T1 (tests-first): add contract test asserting owner-domain cadence, checkpoint
ordering, and docs references.

T2: publish owner-domain and cadence metadata in allocation contract and targets
overlay.

T3: document checkpoint and escalation handling in doc guides/index.

T4: run contract/docs tests and publish issue evidence.

## Tier Mapping

- Functional: owner/cadence fields present per allocation row
- Conformance: checkpoint + escalation policy fields present and ordered
- Integration: docs surfaces reference plan/cadence metadata
- Regression: contract test enforces invariants across files
